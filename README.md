## Important notes

The way the shopping cart works is described as following:

- Each brick is differente from each other, so each one has a unique identifier.
- A User can have as many bricks as needed.
- A Property can have as many bricks as needed.
- When a user adds a brick to it's shopping cart, the brick is separated from the available bricks.
- If another user attemps to add to it's shopping cart a brick that it's no longer available, the api returns an error.
